I am a current PhD student and [Gates Cambridge Scholar](https://www.gatescambridge.org/) at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university). My research interests include the theory of black hole accretion discs, specifically the production and amplification of magnetic fields via the dynamo process. I study these systems through a mix of theory and simulation using the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code Athena++.

Before moving to the UK, I studied physics and applied mathematics at the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/) in Australia, where I recieved my Bachelors and Honours degrees. See the [Projects](https://www.paytonelyce.com/project/) page for some of my previous work.

In the future I plan to work towards self-consistent models and realistic simulations of AGN which include accretion disks, jets, and coronae — a true “unified theory” of AGN.
