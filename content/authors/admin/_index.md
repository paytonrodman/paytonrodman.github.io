Hi, I'm Payton!

I am a data scientist with a background in physics simulations and a love for effective data communication. I believe that the data we collect, analyse, and disseminate contains a multitude of stories based on our audience's perceptions, lived experiences, and needs. This belief underlies my approach to presentations--and information sharing more broadly--as story-telling. I am also an avid puzzler, problem-solver, and bug finder, and am always searching for new ways to improve my coding craft.

Before moving to the UK, I studied physics and applied mathematics at the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/) in Australia, where I received my Bachelors (2017) and Honours (2018) degrees. In 2024, I was awarded my PhD in Astronomy from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university), supported by the [Gates Cambridge Scholarship](https://www.gatescambridge.org/).
