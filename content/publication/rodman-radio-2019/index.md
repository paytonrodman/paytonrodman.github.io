abstract: We investigate the role of environment on radio galaxy properties by constructing
  a sample of large ($\gtrsim~100$ kpc), nearby ($z<0.3$) radio sources identiﬁed as
  part of the Radio Galaxy Zoo citizen science project. Our sample consists of 16
  Fanaroff-Riley Type II (FR-II) sources, 6 FR-I sources, and 1 source with a hybrid
  morphology. FR-I sources appear to be hosted by more massive galaxies, consistent
  with previous studies. In the FR-II sample, we compare the degree of asymmetry in
  radio lobe properties to asymmetry in the radio source environment, quantiﬁed through
  optical galaxy clustering. We ﬁnd that the length of radio lobes in FR-II sources
  is anticorrelated with both galaxy clustering and lobe luminosity. These results
  are in quantitative agreement with predictions from radio source dynamical models
  and suggest that galaxy clustering provides a useful proxy for the ambient gas density
  distribution encountered by the radio lobes.
