abstract: We present the results from a pair of high-resolution, long-timescale (∼105GM/c3), global,
  three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical accretion disk simulations with differing initial
  magnetic plasma β in order to study the effects of the initial toroidal field strength on
  the production of a large-scale poloidal field. We initialize our disks in approximate
  equilibrium with purely toroidal magnetic fields of strength β0 = 5 and 200. We also perform
  a limited resolution study. We find that simulations of differing field strengths diverge
  early in their evolution and remain distinct over the time studied, indicating that the
  initial magnetic conditions leave a persistent imprint in our simulations. Neither simulation
  enters the magnetically arrested disk regime. Both simulations are able to produce poloidal
  fields from initially toroidal fields, with the β0 = 5 simulation evolving clear signs of a
  large-scale poloidal field. We make a cautionary note that computational artifacts in the
  form of large-scale vortices may be introduced in the combination of initially weak field
  and disk-internal mesh refinement boundaries, as evidenced by the production of an m = 1
  mode overdensity in the weak field simulation. Our results demonstrate that the initial
  toroidal field strength plays a vital role in the simulated disk evolution for the models studied.
