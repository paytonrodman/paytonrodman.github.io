You should do whatever is best for you! A PhD can be a lot of fun and the qualification may be useful to you, but it’s also 3-8+ years of your life on relatively low pay and the applications often do cost money.

I will say that the return on investment for a PhD may not be as high as you imagine, and that it’s quite likely you could get the same jobs with a Masters degree, or even just your Bachelors. Whether or not you truly need a PhD to reach your career goals is the first thing you have to figure out. After that, it’s really a matter of whether you want to or not. 

It is true that the PhD will always be there, and you can theoretically come back to the idea in the future but bear in mind that it can get harder to procure application documents the longer you wait. This is particularly true in the case of letters of recommendation. A short gap of <5 years is unlikely to be a problem, but it may get harder once you’re passing decades.
