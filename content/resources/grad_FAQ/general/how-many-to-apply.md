This can vary hugely by field, country, and individual! It’s largely a function of how competitive that program is and your relative position in the applicant pool but will also be set by your own preferences and constraints. As you can see in my profile, I applied to 4, but this list was originally planned to be much longer (>10) in line with the norm of my field. I cut back on the number because the application process–especially across multiple countries with different academic years–became too much work.

Researching, writing, and managing your applications can be a lot of work, and if you have other commitments vying for your time then you should be realistic with your school list and not overcommit yourself. A rushed application is a worse application and may be bad enough that you stand no reasonable chance of acceptance. Forcing yourself to push out a lot of these rushed applications therefore isn’t in your best interest, and likely isn’t a good use of your time or money. However, while it is true that you only need 1 offer, it’s always better to have a handful to choose from so you can maximise your funding, fit, and overall happiness. These are competing interests, and the number of schools you apply to is set by your personal balance point of these factors.

In terms of the notion of “safety”, “match”, and “reach”, these are more suited to undergraduate admissions and you shouldn’t consider them. A true “safety” is any option which is 100% guaranteed, and so the only safety you have is the program you currently hold an official, unconditional offer to. If you are reading this for advice then you probably haven’t even started applying yet, let alone have offers, and so this concept of a “safety” is worthless in planning where to apply to. In terms of “match” and “reach”: it can be incredibly hard to gauge what your profile looks like relative to the pool of applicants you compete against. Your own undergraduate group is unrepresentative, as are all research programs you’ve been a part of, and all internet chat boards. So, while the terms “match” and “reach” probably could be applied to the programs on your list, you can only know which is which in hindsight, if ever. The only exception here are programs which you do not meet the clearly stated entry requirements for. These can be a true gamble depending on your precise background in relation to the program.
