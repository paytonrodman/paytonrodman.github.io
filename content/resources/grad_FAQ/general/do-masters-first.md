Firstly, this will be dictated by your current qualifications and the stated entry requirements for the program you’re applying to. This varies both by the country of origin for your previous degrees and the country you’re applying to for PhD.

Assuming a Masters isn’t strictly required in your case, it then comes down to preferences and finances. If your previous degrees were in a slightly different area then you may want to “get your feet wet” in the new subject with a shorter degree before jumping headfirst into a lengthy PhD. You might also feel that you’d like more research experience, or a chance to take (or retake) certain classes in order to be more competitive for PhD programs.

Depending on where you are coming from, a Masters degree may be relatively simple to get in the sense that it e.g. comes as the fourth year of your undergraduate degree, or is automatically fully-funded. In other cases, Masters can require separate applications and may be expensive.
