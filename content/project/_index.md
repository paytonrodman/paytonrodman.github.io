All of my research is broadly focused on the topic of **Active Galactic Nuclei**, or AGN for short. These are supermassive black holes (SMBH) that are located at the centre of a host galaxy and are consuming large amounts of gas and dust. This high activity causes the region around the black hole to glow brightly across all of the electromagnetic spectrum, and may sometimes also release massive jets of relativistic plasma from near the poles of the black hole itself. Hence AGN contain an SMBH, a disk or torus of accreting material, and (sometimes) jets of relativistic plasma. 

AGN are referred to by many names - quasar, blazar, broad line radio galaxies, and Seyfert galaxies to name a few. These refer to AGN of different powers and luminosities, exhibiting different spectral features, and orientated at different angles to our line of sight.
