Competitive scholarships are, well, competitive, and all else being equal, grades are an easy way to distinguish between applicants. {{< hl >}}A perfect GPA won't necessarily help you{{< /hl >}}, but a lower GPA can certainly harm you. 

On a US 4.0 GPA scale, where an A grade is worth 4.0, a B grade 3.0 etc, your average Gates scholar will have achieved above a 3.9. As for Rhodes, in the Australian grading system there is a strict grade requirement of first-class Honours, but even in this window they will rarely take anyone with a GPA below 6.75/7.00 on the Australian scale, and the winners have an average GPA of around 3.8/4.0 on the US scale.

This isn't merely some pointless hoop to jump through. Since being at Cambridge (I write this in my second year), I've realised that the undergraduates here and at Oxford are often at least 1 whole year ahead of the students at other institutions. Even if you have a degree from MIT, you are no exception to this and will find yourself playing catch-up. The high bar on entry is to ensure that you can keep up, because placing you into such a fast-paced environment without adequate preparation isn't "providing you with an opportunity", it's cruel and setting you up for devastating failure, and Cambridge/Oxford knows it. On the flip side, if they have admitted you then they are saying you can handle the workload, and you should not doubt them on it.

However, even if you're scraping the bottom of the minimum requirement, it can still be worth your time to apply. You can always {{< hl >}}ask your department at Cambridge or your Rhodes representative{{< /hl >}} to give you an idea of your chances. They have seen many people apply for Gates/Rhodes and will have a better idea of who might be successful.
