Competitive scholarships are, well, competitive, and all else being equal, grades are an easy way to distinguish between applicants. A perfect GPA won't necessarily help you, but a lower GPA can certainly harm you. Only Rhodes seems to have a strict grade requirement of first-class Honours, but be aware that there are “effective” minimums too. Rhodes will rarely take anyone with a GPA below 6.75/7.00 on the Australian scale, and the winners have an average GPA of around 3.8/4.0 on the US scale. The average Gates GPA is above 3.9/4.0 on the US scale, so it is as selective as Rhodes in that respect. For Gates in particular, your academics are the first hurdle to satisfy (see section the biggest difference above) and there is little to no chance to make up for a weakness here.

However, even if you're scraping the bottom of the minimum requirement, it can still be worth your time to apply. You can always ask your department at Cambridge or your Rhodes representative to give you an idea of your chances. They have seen many people apply for Gates/Rhodes and will have a better idea of who might be successful. If you find that you are not likely to be successful, or that you don’t qualify, check out what if I don’t win below.
