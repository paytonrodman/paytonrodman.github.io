Competitive scholarships are, well, competitive, and all else being equal, grades are an easy way to distinguish between applicants. {{< hl >}}A perfect GPA won't necessarily help you{{< /hl >}}, but a lower GPA can certainly harm you. 

On a US 4.0 GPA scale, where an A grade is worth 4.0, a B grade 3.0 etc, your average Gates scholar will have achieved above a 3.9. As for Rhodes, in the Australian grading system there is a strict grade requirement of first-class Honours, but even in this window they will rarely take anyone with a GPA below 6.75/7.00 on the Australian scale, and the winners have an average GPA of around 3.8/4.0 on the US scale.

This isn't merely some pointless hoop to jump through. Since being at Cambridge (I write this in my second year), I've realised that the undergraduates here and at Oxford are often at least 1 whole year ahead of the students at other institutions. Even if you have a degree from MIT, you are no exception to this and will most likely find yourself playing catch-up. As Oxbridge are such vibrant places, with so many opportunities and extracurriculars to join in on, no one wants you to have to spend all of your free time studying.

However, even if you're scraping the bottom of the minimum requirement, it's still be worth your time to apply. You can always {{< hl >}}ask your department at Cambridge or your local Rhodes representative{{< /hl >}} to give you an idea of your chances. They have seen many people apply for Gates/Rhodes and will have a better idea of who might be successful. I prefer not to weigh in on chance-me's since I only have a sample size of 1â€”myself.
