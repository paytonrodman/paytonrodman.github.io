The [Gates-Cambridge scholarship](https://www.gatescambridge.org/) was established in 2000 with a large donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is tenable at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) for Masters and PhD studies, with some exceptions and limitations.

It covers the full University Composition fee (i.e. your tuition), a very competitive stipend (£17,500 p.a. for 2020/21), a single economy airfare at the beginning and end of your course, and the inbound visa and health surcharge costs. 

There are also additional discretionary funds available to scholars, including funds to attend conferences, a family allowance (for those who will bring children with them), fieldwork assistance, parental leave, and hardship funds. As an aside, I have found the Gates community to be incredibly compassionate during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they covered extra flights home and back to the UK. 

In short, it is a full-cost scholarship. About the only thing it doesn't cover is the application fee to the University itself, which currently sits at around £60.
