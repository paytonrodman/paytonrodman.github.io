_Competitive scholarships are, well, competitive, and all else being equal, grades are an easy way to distinguish between applicants. A perfect GPA wonâ€™t necessarily help you, but a lower GPA can certainly harm you._

On a US 4.0 GPA scale, where an A grade is worth 4.0, a B grade 3.0 etc, your average Gates scholar will have achieved above a 3.9.

On this same scale, the minimum acceptable GPA for admission to Cambridge sits somewhere between 3.5-3.7 (the equivalent of 2.i Honours, or "upper second class"), so there is some floor below which a scholarship offer will not be possible, but there is some wiggle room above this. You should aim for as high as possible, but a 3.7-3.8, while not ideal, is certainly no dealbreaker. 

This isn't merely some pointless hoop to jump through. Since being at Cambridge (I write this in my second year), I've realised that the undergraduates here are at least **1 whole year** ahead of the students at other institutions. Even if you have a degree from MIT, you are no exception to this and **will** find yourself playing catch-up. The high bar on entry is to ensure that you can keep up, because placing you into such a fast-paced environment without adequate preparation isn't "providing you with an opportunity", it's cruel and setting you up for devastating failure, and Cambridge knows it. On the flip side, if they have admitted you then they are saying you can handle the workload, and you should not doubt them on it.
