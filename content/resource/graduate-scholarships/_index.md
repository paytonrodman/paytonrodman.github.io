I was turned down from the Rhodes scholarship in late 2018 and accepted for the Gates-Cambridge scholarship in early 2019. After going through the selection for both and coming out the other end experiencing both success and failure, I realised how unprepared I’d been for the process. If you’re like I was–coming from a less affluent background and without institutional training/mentoring–hopefully you will find this guide helpful. 

Obvious disclaimer though: I applied for a specific area of astrophysics from a specific state in Australia. Selection for these scholarships varies by location, subject, and year, and a great deal by individual. My view is only my own and I cannot give specific advice to individuals.
