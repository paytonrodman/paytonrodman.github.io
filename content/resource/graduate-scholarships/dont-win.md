Don't beat yourself up!

It's important to realise that a lot of successful applicants actually win on their second try, after they've had a chance to practice the whole lot, reflect, and improve their application. I think the Rhodes failure (both of them!) was critical to me being successful for Gates as it gave me experience with the application process and interview.

But even if you aren't able or willing to try again, remember that these programs are always going to be biased towards a certain kind of person and that it isnâ€™t necessarily a good predictor of success, intelligence, hard work, tenacity, dedication, or any other broadly positive character trait. The kinds of social achievements that these programs value and reward are also the more flashy kind. These may be harder to get in certain fields, and they aren't always the best way to help a community. At some level, having these achievements comes down to a heavy dose of luck too. I wasn't aware of the Rhodes and Gates-Cambridge scholarships prior to the application season I applied in, so there wasn't any time to add more large projects or become a more competitive applicant in general. If you're reading this and are beyond your second year of university, don't worry too much about being "behind". Both Oxford and Cambridge offer a raft of other scholarships, just make sure that you know what those are and how to apply for them. (Pro-tip: the individual colleges offer their own scholarships, so check their websites)

You can be an absolutely fantastic, highly successful academic and leader and yet never make it beyond the first round for either scholarship. And there are many, many successful academics and leaders who were never even eligible to apply.

I will warn that Rhodes announces its winners and losers in quite a public fashion, after which you have to mingle with everyone's family and friends, along with the press and distinguished guests, while still reeling from the news. We even had a tour of Government House that included going up to the roof and seeing the royal rooms, although everyone seemed pretty shaken and there was little conversation. I think I gave a TV interview at this stage, but the shock hadn't worn off so I doubt I was a great conversationalist. Just go through the motions to get through the event: congratulate the winner, congratulate their family, congratulate the runners-ups and everyone who looks in your general direction, smile, nod, and look engaged as strangers talk to you and your family.

Then go and get some pizza.
