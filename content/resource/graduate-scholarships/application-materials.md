Here are the stated application materials I had to submit, taken from the websites of each scholarship in the year I applied. I'll discuss some tips for a few of these in the relevant section (linked).

As always, these are only to give you a general idea; you should always follow the most recent (official) documents, even if they contradict what I have here. The Rhodes scholarship in particular has some quite complex requirements for residency that I won't go into but which you should definitely be familiar with, so make sure you check the website.
