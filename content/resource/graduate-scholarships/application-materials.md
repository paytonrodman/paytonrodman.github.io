Here are the stated application materials I had to submit, taken from the websites of each scholarship in the year I applied. I'll discuss some tips for a few of these in the relevant section (in bold).

As always, these are only to give you a general idea; you should always follow the most recent (official) documents, even if they contradict what I have here. The Rhodes scholarship in particular has some quite complex requirements for residency that I won't go into but which you should definitely be familiar with, so make sure you check the website.

### Rhodes

 - Documentation to prove age, and citizenship or residency
 
 - Transcripts (Part 1)
 
 - A full CV (3-page limit; Part 2)
 
 - A personal statement (1000 word limit; Part 3)
 
 - An outline of your proposed research (DPhil applicants; Part 4)
 
 - Six LORs, three of which should be academic (Part 5)
 
 - Head and shoulders photograph
 
### Gates

 - Documents submitted as part of regular course application (e.g. transcripts - Part 1)
 
 - CV/resume (Part 2)
 
 - Personal statement (3000 char. limit; Part 3)
 
 - Research proposal (PhD applicants; Part 4)
 
 - Gates character LOR (Part 5)
