As part of the application process, and prior to the interview, you are required to attend a social event with the other finalists and the panel members who will be interviewing you. This is quite a nerve-wracking experience, especially if you haven't been trained for it.

My events were held at Government House (in Tasmania and then the ACT), hosted by the governor of Tasmania and the Governor-General, respectively. We arrived before dinner for some light drinks and stiff small-talk with the other finalists and the panellists, before sitting down to a 3-course dinner. In eating dinner, you cannot begin until the governor does and must stop when they do. The food is kinda fancy and a little bizarre, and as with most food at these kinds of events, you can be sure there'll be asparagus hidden somewhere in the dish. Just follow everyone else’s lead if it looks like a complicated meal, and have leftovers or quick meals ready at home in case you don’t like the food at the event.

In Tasmania, we remained in our assigned seats for the evening. In the ACT, candidates rotated seats between every course with the view that we'd get to sit and talk to more of the panellists. As it turned out, my rotations only moved me through the end of the table with administrators and support staff of the Governor-General. Building a rapport with the panel is important, and things may have worked out differently had I had a chance to speak to them at dinner.

In general, you should dress in business formal unless stated otherwise, and if you're completely lost, you can do what I did: head to Myer and explain the situation to the store attendants. I have tattoos, and I made the choice to cover these for the dinner. They don't seem to be an issue in academia in general, but you never know how conservative someone might be (especially if most panellists are in industry). If you have tattoos or piercings, it’s entirely up to you whether you cover those or not. If I had the same choice today, I would keep my tattoos visible, but I recognise I’m making this statement from a considerably privileged position.

There'll be alcohol, but I'd recommend that you either abstain or pace yourself very carefully; a little bit might help calm your nerves and make you more conversational, but too much and you'll say something stupid. If you know you don't want to drink at all, the polite thing is to let the host know before you sit for dinner so that they can take your wine glasses away, or to turn the glass upside down or to cover it when you sit at the table. For both this event and the later interview, some panel members may be quite combative and you will be asked for your opinion on some heavy topics; read up on recent events and don't take it too personally if someone gets argumentative or even plain rude. They just want to see how you’ll handle yourself under a bit of pressure.
