The Rhodes scholarship was established in 1902 in the will of business man and politician, Cecil John Rhodes. It is tenable at Oxford University in the UK, mostly for postgraduate degrees (Masters/PhD), although there are exceptions.

It lasts for 2 years in the first instance but can be extended to 3 years in the case of DPhil (aka PhD) studies. It covers university fees on top of providing a stipend, airfares at the beginning and end of your program, a small settling-in allowance, health surcharges, and the application fee.

The Gates-Cambridge scholarship is much newer, having been established in 2000 with a large donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is tenable at the University of Cambridge, again for Masters and PhD, and again with some exceptions. It covers the same general costs as Rhodes does, with their total value being comparable. Gates, however, is much less well-known on an international level due to how new it is, and it comes with a smaller alumni network to match.

Further information can be found on the Rhodes and Gates-Cambridge websites, which you should become very familiar with.
