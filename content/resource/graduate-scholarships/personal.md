{{% alert warning %}}
The Rhodes scholarship expressly forbids that you get any help or feedback for this statement. No one can review any draft or give any substantial advice. It must be entirely your own work. For this reason, I will not review or provide feedback on this document.

Grades act as a minimum cut-off and the interview is a sort of final selection stage, but the part in-between where most candidates are actually rejected is based on the personal statement. This is your chance to convey who you are and to convince the committee to give you a shot, so don't rush it and don't leave it till last. Also: make it your own. You can find examples online and I've included my own (for [Gates](https://www.paytonelyce.com/files/Gates_statement.pdf) and for [Rhodes](https://www.paytonelyce.com/files/Rhodes_personal_statement.pdf)) for an idea of tone as well, but you will be immediately caught if you copy any of these sources. If you have read this page then so have the people on the committee. If you want a scholarship, do not plagiarise.

The most important thing to remember is that your application is a group of items, so {{< hl >}}don't repeat information unnecessarily{{< /hl >}}. You don't need to say you have a high GPA or list your awards if that's included in your transcript and CV. Instead, focus on the parts of yourself that are not conveyed elsewhere: your personality, your background, and your goals. Someone reading your statement should be able to easily identify your key traits from it.

The Rhodes statement leaves enough room to discuss yourself, your experience, and your goals, even if only in brief. The Gates statement, on the other hand, is painfully limited (3000 chars ≈ 200 words), and you will need to construct this one with plenty of care.

For the overall piece, look carefully at the rest of your application and compare it to the "ideal" candidate qualities. Look for which areas you're lacking in — this is where your statement should focus. In my case, my academics were already satisfied by my transcript, publication, and research proposal, leaving the leadership and service side of things. Applicants will usually be strong in 2-3 areas, so {{< hl >}}identify your weak area and try to shore it up through your statement{{< /hl >}}, but be prepared to back this all up during interviews. Don't make statements or portray an image you can't authentically support.
