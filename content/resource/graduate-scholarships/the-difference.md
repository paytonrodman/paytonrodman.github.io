Both Rhodes and Gates require separate applications, but they differ in how these applications are managed.

{{< hl >}}The application for Rhodes is quite separate to the application to Oxford{{< /hl >}}, meaning you have to submit far more supporting documentation compared to Gates. It also means that pre-selection is left up to the home institution, i.e. your alma mater which will be nominating you. You cannot apply for Rhodes without the support and approval of your local representative, so applicants who have little to no chance of being successful are weeded out early on.

{{< hl >}}Gates, on the other hand, outsources its pre-selection to Cambridge itself{{< /hl >}}. You apply firstly to your department at Cambridge, and in the application you simply fill out the relevant sections for the Gates scholarship and any other scholarships you'd like to apply for. As part of the admissions process at Cambridge, all applicants are given a score out of 30 (although this may vary by department) for their academic/research aptitude. Only the best (approx. >27/30) are then nominated to the Gates shortlist. Of the around 5000 non-US applicants to Gates each year, perhaps only 100 will make it to the shortlist that the Gates committee interview, the rest either not being recommended by their department or not selected for interviewing, and from that, around 55 will be chosen as scholars. Your biggest hurdle is to get to the shortlist, so don't neglect your Cambridge application!
