The Rhodes scholarship application requires the most letters of recommendation (LORs) at six, with Oxford itself requiring another three, although you can double up on those. This is due to the fact that the Rhodes application is so disjointed and separate to the Oxford application. Gates, by contrast, requires three, two of which are automatically taken from your application to Cambridge so only one extra letter is needed, and this third letter doesn't have to be written by a third person.

For Rhodes, your six letters should be split evenly between academics and character, so you should get three letters from professors and research supervisors, and the other three from people who know you from sports, service, or community work. The three academic letters are the ones you would resubmit to Oxford as part of your course application. This is a lot of letters to ask for, and it's normal to only have 4-5 really strong ones. Because you need to curate so many people, think carefully about what you'd like each person to say or talk about, and be sure to remind them of these events. Some of your letter writers may know you in more than one context (e.g. academics and community work), so make sure they know which context you'd like them to focus on. Keep track of who has submitted what, and decide when/how you will remind people to submit their letters.

The Gates process here is much simpler in comparison. The only extra letter you need to organise is a sort of “character reference”. Many applicants ask one of their two academic letter writers to also write the character letter, but make sure they're aware of your plan before they write either, otherwise they may end up repeating themselves in one or both letters.

I can't give you a whole lot more advice here since it's not generally accepted in physics for students to read their letters, or to draft them, so I don't know what mine said.
