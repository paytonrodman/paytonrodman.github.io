In general, both Rhodes and Gates are looking for students who are {{< hl >}}academically and socially accomplished{{< /hl >}}. That first point is usually not too hard to place in context–you want a high GPA, relevant experience for your field, and some publications or conference posters/presentations (if possible and relevant to your field). But the second point is a bit more nebulous. What does “socially accomplished” even mean? It doesn't mean that you have to be highly extroverted, it just means that you need to {{< hl >}}exist beyond your coursework{{< /hl >}} and beyond the bubble of your field. People generally show this through a few very large activities, like being a national champion in a particular sport, or being a talented musician. There is also a strong preference for people who are going to make the world better in some way, so some combination of community work, outreach, and/or volunteering are expected. But these should not be done lightly, and the committee can immediately see through any last-minute attempts to bump your volunteering hours. These activities need to mean a lot to you. They have to tie in with the over-arching story and image of who you are.

There is more specific advice described by the funding bodies themselves, which you can find on their respective websites. I'll go through a few extra details that I think are worth discussing though.

### Rhodes

The elephant-in-the-room when it comes to Rhodes is {{< hl >}}sports{{< /hl >}}. The Rhodes scholarship has a long history of requiring and preferring that applicants have a strong sporting background, and while it's no longer a requirement, a preference does still exist. It can be supplanted by involvement in e.g. musics/arts, but in general you do need to have an additional activity that you have practiced for a long time. Personally, I have practiced martial arts for a long time. Other real examples from candidates (both unsuccessful and successful) include playing multiple instruments and an avid love for hiking.

There is also quite a strong preference for fields that have a direct and immediate impact on people. Many who win Rhodes are entering law, politics, international relations, medicine, areas relating to climate change, etc. I noticed that even those applicants with less conventional backgrounds were often proposing to move into law or medicine. This is the case for many competitive scholarship programs aimed at making change in the world.

### Gates

Unlike Rhodes, Gates is decidedly more accepting of “scholarship for scholarship's sake”, which is evident by the fact that they accepted a fair handful of astrophysicists in my year along with multiple classicists. This is undoubtedly helped by the fact that there are {{< hl >}}different interviewing panels for different groups of subjects{{< /hl >}}. You are still expected to be a leader and to herald change, but this change could be within your own field and you do not need to literally save lives to do this. The preferences of the panel will change each year though, and there are no quotas for different subjects so you should not expect e.g. 3 scholarships awarded in chemistry. There may be many in one year and none in the next.

Part of the benefit of being such a new program is that there is less tradition to contend with. But on the flip-side, there's also far less information widely available on what Gates prefers in its applicants and less mentoring within universities for people wishing to apply.
