In general, both Rhodes and Gates are looking for students who are {{< hl >}}academically and socially accomplished{{< /hl >}}. That first point is usually not too hard to place in context–you want a high GPA, relevant experience for your field, and some publications or conference posters/presentations (if possible and relevant to your field). But the second point is a bit more nebulous. What does “socially accomplished” even mean? It doesn't mean that you have to be highly extroverted, it just means that you need to {{< hl >}}exist beyond your coursework{{< /hl >}} and beyond the bubble of your field.

Volunteer work that you sought out on your own volition is worth much more than volunteer work which was required to pass a class. Systems or programs that you spearheaded are worth more again. The aim of the game is to show **initiative**. Any common garden gnome can follow the pack and apply to advertised positions, but it takes extra insight and determination to create something new.

Some show their leadership skills through a few very large activities, like being a national champion in a particular sport, or being a talented musician. There is also a strong preference for people who are going to make the world better in some way, so some combination of community work, outreach, and/or volunteering are expected. But these should not be done lightly, and the committee can immediately see through any last-minute attempts to bump your volunteering hours. These activities need to mean a lot to you. They have to tie in with the over-arching story and image of who you are.

There is more specific advice described by the funding bodies themselves, which you can find on their respective websites. I'll go through a few extra details that I think are worth discussing though.

### Rhodes

The elephant-in-the-room when it comes to Rhodes is {{< hl >}}sports{{< /hl >}}. The Rhodes scholarship has a long history of requiring and preferring that applicants have a strong sporting background, and while it's no longer a requirement, a preference does still exist. It can be supplanted by involvement in e.g. musics/arts, but in general you do need to have an additional activity that you have practiced for a long time. Personally, I have practiced martial arts for a long time. Other real examples from candidates (both unsuccessful and successful) include playing multiple instruments and an avid love for hiking.

There is also quite a strong preference for fields that have a direct and immediate impact on people. Many who win Rhodes are entering law, politics, international relations, medicine, areas relating to climate change, etc. I noticed that even those applicants with less conventional backgrounds were often proposing to move into law or medicine. This is the case for many competitive scholarship programs aimed at making change in the world.

### Gates

Unlike Rhodes, Gates is decidedly more accepting of “scholarship for scholarship's sake”, which is evident by the fact that they accepted a fair handful of astrophysicists in my year along with multiple classicists. This is undoubtedly helped by the fact that there are {{< hl >}}different interviewing panels for different groups of subjects{{< /hl >}}. You are still expected to be a leader and to herald change, but this change could be within your own field and you do not need to literally save lives to do this. The preferences of the panel will change each year though, and there are no quotas for different subjects so you should not expect e.g. 3 scholarships awarded in chemistry. There may be many in one year and none in the next.

You should also keep in mind that the US and "international" (non-US) rounds are separate. In reading through other guides from the US, there seems to be a different style or set of preferences in applicants compared to those from other countries. If you are not applying to the US round but spend your time reading the backgrounds of US applicants, you may find yourself unfairly pessimistic on your chances. In reality, these are different rounds and your achievements will be assessed in light of their context.

Part of the benefit of being such a new program is that there is less tradition to contend with for the Gates scholarship. But on the flip-side, there's also far less information widely available on what Gates prefers in its applicants and less mentoring within universities for people wishing to apply.
