The Rhodes scholarship is very open about what it wants in a candidate.

Taken directly from their website:

> Rhodes Selection Committees are looking for young people of outstanding intellect, character, leadership, and commitment to service. 

> The four criteria which governed the selection of Rhodes Scholars in 1902 are still the guiding criteria for the selection of Rhodes Scholars:

> - literary and scholastic attainments (academic excellence)
> - energy to use one's talents to the full (as demonstrated by mastery in areas such as sports, music, debate, dance, theatre, and artistic pursuits, particularly where teamwork is involved)
> - truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship
> - moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one's fellow beings.

The first is easy enough to understand: they want to see high grades. Academics can also be supplemented by research achievements and academic awards, but these things will tend to be correlated with grades still.

The second point can be slightly more confusing. The elephant-in-the-room when it comes to Rhodes is sports. The Rhodes scholarship has a long history of requiring and preferring that applicants have a strong sporting background, and while itâ€™s no longer a requirement, a preference does still exist. It can be supplanted by involvement in e.g. musics/arts, but in general you do need to have an additional activity that you have practiced for a long time, and sports just so happens to be the easiest way to fulfil that criteria and so the "preference" (if you can call it that) for sports stays. Personally, I have practiced martial arts for a long time. Other real examples from candidates (both successful and unsuccessful) include playing multiple instruments and an avid love for hiking.

There is also quite a strong preference for fields that have a direct and immediate impact on people, which feeds into the third and fourth points. Many who win Rhodes are entering law, politics, international relations, medicine, areas relating to climate change, etc. I noticed that even those applicants with less conventional backgrounds were often proposing to move into law, medicine, or politics. This is the case for many competitive scholarship programs aimed at making change in the world.

When it comes to showing your "moral force of character" and "instincts to lead", remember that results are worth more than intent *or* effort. By that, I mean that spending a cumulative 500 hours in a soup kitchen is far inferior to spending 50 hours designing and overseeing a social programme that gets homeless people into houses. The former is a simple contribution, while the latter is a meaningful change. For this reason, you can't simply pad your resume with volunteer activities.
