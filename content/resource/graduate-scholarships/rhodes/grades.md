_Competitive scholarships are, well, competitive, and all else being equal, grades are an easy way to distinguish between applicants. A perfect GPA won’t necessarily help you, but a lower GPA can certainly harm you._

In the Australian grading system, Rhodes has a strict grade requirement of first-class Honours, but be aware that there are otheer “effective” minimums too. Rhodes will rarely take anyone with a GPA below 6.75/7.00 on the Australian scale, and the winners have an average GPA of around 3.8/4.0 on the US scale.

Given that the minimum grade required for admission to your Oxford degree is likely upper-second (2.i) or first-class Honours (~3.5-3.7 GPA), the expectations for Rhodes are not ludicrously high.

Why such a high bar to start with? It's partly because Oxford can afford it: loads of people with high GPAs/grades apply, and so they get to be choosy amongst them. It's also partly for your own good: Oxford is fast-paced and the students are advanced, and you must prove you can keep up. No Rhodes scholar should *ever* drop out. 

#### Not sure if your grades are high enough?
Talk to your local Rhodes representative! It's their job to help filter applicants and they can advise you on any weak points.
