First, to give you some context, I should explain my background!

**Undergrad Institution:** UTAS. Not well known, even within Australia. A very small physics department.    
**Major(s):** Physics, Applied Mathematics    
**Minor(s):** N/A    
**GPA in Major:** 7.0 (/7.0)    
**Overall GPA:** 7.0 (/7.0)    
**Length of Degree:** 3 years    
**Year graduated**: 2017    
**Position in Class:** Top?

**Honours Institution:** UTAS    
**Specialisation:** Physics    
**Overall GPA:** 7.0 (/7.0)    
**Length of Degree:** 1 year    
**Year graduated**: 2018    
**Position in Class:** N/A    

**Research Experience:** A summer project with my university at the end of first year that resulted in a first-author publication. A summer project at the end of second year with CSIRO. A year with my university for Honours year.

**Awards/Honors/Recognitions:** Quite a lot of scholarships and awards, but my university had ones for each year of the degree, which inflates the list a fair amount. There were a few university-wide awards, plus special scholarships and travel funds for research things. I was awarded the University Medal, but not until *after* all PhD applications were submitted, so it did not factor.

**Pertinent Activities or Jobs:** Casual tutoring and marking work for undergraduate physics throughout my degree. Some volunteer work for university Open Days and Cub Scout camps. A fair few public lectures and school visits.

**Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:** Some of the extracurriculars I was involved in were large enough events to make the TV and print news. I think being "google-able" in that sense is always a bit of a plus.

**Special Bonus Points:** My Honours supervisor was familiar with Oxford and Cambridge, and so could probably write a letter in the style they prefer (whatever that may be).
