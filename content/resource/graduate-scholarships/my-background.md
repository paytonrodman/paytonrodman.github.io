First, to give you some context, I should explain my background!

### The details

**Undergrad Institution:** UTAS. Not well known, even within Australia. A very small physics department.    
**Major(s):** Physics, Applied Mathematics    
**Minor(s):** N/A    
**GPA in Major:** 7.0 (/7.0)    
**Overall GPA:** 7.0 (/7.0)    
**Length of Degree:** 3 years    
**Year graduated**: 2017    
**Position in Class:** Top?

**Honours (~Masters) Institution:** UTAS    
**Specialisation:** Physics    
**Overall GPA:** 7.0 (/7.0)    
**Length of Degree:** 1 year    
**Year graduated**: 2018    
**Position in Class:** N/A    

**Research Experience:** A summer project with my university at the end of first year that resulted in a first-author publication. A summer project at the end of second year with CSIRO. A year with my university for Honours year.

**Awards/Honors/Recognitions:** Quite a lot of scholarships and awards, but my university had ones for each year of the degree, which inflates the list a fair amount. There were a few university-wide awards, plus special scholarships and travel funds for research things. I was awarded the University Medal, but not until *after* all PhD applications were submitted, so it did not factor.

**Pertinent Activities or Jobs:** Casual tutoring and marking work for undergraduate physics throughout my degree. Some volunteer work for university Open Days and Cub Scout camps. A fair few public lectures and school visits.

**Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:** Some of the extracurriculars I was involved in were large enough events to make the TV and print news. I think being "google-able" in that sense is always a bit of a plus.

**Special Bonus Points:** My Honours supervisor was familiar with Oxford and Cambridge, and so could probably write a letter in the style they prefer (whatever that may be).

### Debrief

Between my grades and research experience, I was obviously quite competitive for Oxbridge. You have to keep that in mind when reading this guide—I don't have experience overcoming a low GPA or a lack of research experience. Because of that, my approach in these applications was to focus on my leadership activities. You are quite likely to have a very different application profile to me, and so it's important to remember to {{< hl >}}focus your effort in weaker spots, whatever they may be{{< /hl >}}.

So what makes me any different to all the other people who write guides? Well, I'm not from a fancy university, nor even one that's very well known. I didn't get into research during high school or have any prior connections to a university. My family is not university-educated, and the area where I grew up is not affluent. I did not do research continuously during undergrad—if you count it up, I did maybe 16 weeks full time over 2 summers and nothing during semester. All of my other extracurriculars were relatively sporadic too, with a few hours of tutoring and 1-2 weeks set aside for school visits, plus specific events like Open Days. I wasn't a member of any societies and certainly didn't lead committees for anything. For the majority of any year, I was simply working and studying as a full-time student. I didn't even know the Rhodes and Gates scholarships existed until the year I applied. Compared to many other scholars I might seem downright *plain*. But I managed it nonetheless, and perhaps you can too with the right application approach.
