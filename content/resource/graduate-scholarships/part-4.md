In my experience, the Rhodes scholarship application can be very unclear when it comes to this item. The information online suggests that you only need to discuss your career/research goals within your personal statement, but when you go to submit these documents online, you may instead be asked for a separate research proposal. The requirements for this document are the same as what your department specifies for their research proposal. For astrophysics, though, the department effectively wanted a personal statement instead, meaning I had to double-up a bit. In my case, I made my "research proposal" much more technical and specialised to astrophysics than my personal statement, otherwise one would have been totally redundant.

For Gates, it's expected that you write a proper research proposal either way, following your department's guidelines if they have any. Make sure you keep within the stated page limits. I'd strongly recommend that you ask your proposed supervisor for advice and feedback on this document; it'll help you create a better proposal and the process of writing this document can teach you a lot about your future PhD project. It's also a good idea to ask local PhD students (and professors) for examples of research proposals. These will give you an idea of the different layouts you can have.

Make sure you understand your own research proposal fully, especially for the Gates scholarship, as you can (and likely will) be questioned on it in interview. The same is not necessarily true for Rhodes as their interview panels are much more general, and there may be no one within your panel with enough knowledge of your field to discuss your proposal.

My only real regret is that I didn't include any images or plots in mine, although I didn't really have the space for it. Two pages is not much space once you get started. You can check out mine here, although this is again for my own project in a very particular field, so expectations will vary. It should be noted that my project has deviated significantly from the one I described in the proposalâ€“this is perfectly fine and largely expected. The project will naturally change as you learn more and explore different research questions.
