In Australia we tend to use “CV” and “résumé” interchangeably at many stages, but they are different documents. A résumé is typically quite short (1-2 pages) and will be changed to suit each job you apply for. A curriculum vitae (CV), on the other hand, can extend into 10's of pages as it is a full record of all academic work. As a current or recently-graduated undergrad, your CV will probably be around 2-3 pages in length and will be a blended style halfway between that of a regular résumé and a full academic CV, so the distinction is not so important yet.

Regardless of what you choose to call it at this stage, there are a few simple guidelines to follow, and I'd also recommend Googling “academic CV” for more tips. You can [look at my own](https://www.paytonelyce.com/files/currentCV.pdf) to get an idea of layout, but this is going to be regularly updated and is not the one I originally submitted. And remember: writing a CV is always a fine balance between humility and bragging. Never lie, but never downplay or hide your achievements either. Everything you say should be undeniably true, but the way in which you present those achievements is more of an art form.

 - {{< hl >}}Your CV should be succinct, neat, and clearly laid-out{{< /hl >}}.

 - {{< hl >}}No “creative” fonts, no borders, no coloured or scented paper, no images{{< /hl >}} (whether you should include a head-and-shoulders photo and personal info like marriage status varies by culture–for Australia, UK, and the US, it’s a “no”).

 - {{< hl >}}Use colour wisely and sparingly{{< /hl >}}, if at all, as your document may be printed in B&W.

 - {{< hl >}}Don't use “infographic”-style metrics{{< /hl >}}, like bars or graphs to show competency and skill. Statements should be easily interpretable, and 4 stars out of 5 on “organisation” or “programming” has little meaning.

 - {{< hl >}}Use concrete examples and outcomes to demonstrate skills and achievement{{< /hl >}}. For each job, you should be able to say what you did and what you achieved. Don't be generic here, and be wary of any sentences that start with any version of “I helped do X”. This hides or obscures your contribution.

 - {{< hl >}}Be consistent with layout{{< /hl >}}, e.g. place all dates on the same side of the page and don't mix bullet points with paragraphs. Someone glancing at your CV should be able to immediately pick up on the flow and find the information they need. Selective use of bold, text size, and alignment can help this.

### Rhodes wants more

The Rhodes scholarship application does differ in another key way to Gates: they want more in the CV.

At graduation, your CV would typically omit all work completed prior to entering university, but Rhodes is interested in all work done and all awards received since Year 11. This, along with including your sporting or musical achievements, can really push the 3-page limit on your CV. Look for any places where information has been repeated or multiple lines can be consolidated into one. The goal here isn’t to cram as much as possible into 3 pages, but to carefully curate the “information density” on the page, making sure that the pages aren’t too sparse or too busy.
