If you've been contacted for an interview then you've passed the first hurdle, but the few who remain are all highly qualified like yourself so don't become complacent. Since the first part of this process relies so heavily on academics, I'd recommend forgetting about that part of your application from here on out unless it’s a significant weakness, and instead focus on how to display those leadership qualities that both programs look for.

The precise interview questions you'll be asked depends on yourself (your experience, field, and career goals), the panel, and the round you're interviewing in.

#### In general

Start by collating all of your application materials, then go through each one and try to think of questions you could ask about each part. Write out these questions and then give broad answers to them. Speak out loud. Dictate them. Write them down. Try to imagine the conversation and any additional questions that someone could ask based on your answers. Don't be afraid to take the questioning to quite a deep or personal level; even if these questions are not asked during the interview, you can't answer anything on the day with conviction unless you know yourself and your motivations.

Don't just focus on the good things you've done either. You've certainly made mistakes during your life, so be prepared to discuss these and what you learned from them. You don't always need to portray yourself in the best possible light.

It’s important that your interview convey something that can’t be seen in your CV or personal statement. Where these two documents have facts, the interview needs to have passion. Tell the stories that you didn’t have room to write about. Be sincere and open and avoid scripting–it’s obvious when people do this and makes you sound like a robot.

For both scholarships, it is very likely that no one on your interview panel will be familiar with your field, or that only one person will be. Be prepared to explain your research and its importance using language that is accessible. Avoid jargon and think of analogies you can use in place of rigorous definitions. The more details you throw at people, the less they’re going to remember, so keep it relatively simple and broad. I very generally talked about black hole accretion disks, how they’re important in understanding the evolution of the Universe, and as places to test extreme physics.

Interviews will last for around 20 minutes, which sounds like a long time but actually goes very, very quickly. Practice being succinct, and be aware that while you should take a moment to think before you speak, don't take two moments. Don’t be offended if you are cut off or feel like you’re being rushed by the panel–they have a very tight schedule to get through and set questions they want to ask before you go.

#### Rhodes

Rhodes has two rounds: the first is your local round within your constituency, the second is a national final against all other runners-ups in Canberra. Take some pity on the Canberra folks: this is their only round and they have to compete against the best from the other states. In the first instance, your interview panel would have carefully read your application materials and will ask you questions based on this. Expect them to focus on your weakest areas. Unfortunately there is only one panel for all applicants, and while there is usually at least one person in science, they are unlikely to be in your area of science. This means a large part of your application can't be discussed in any real detail: your proposed research. I think this is a big reason why a lot of fields will rarely elect Rhodes scholars.

In the second instance, things are made "fair" by asking the exact same questions of every single candidate, regardless of field or future plans. This means you may be asked esoteric questions that do not relate to yourself in any way. The challenge is to answer in a way that directs back to yourself in a good way. Since most applicants have a background in law and politics, the questions will focus on those areas and by answering them directly, you risk looking less dedicated to your own field. As an example, we were asked (paraphrasing):

The Prime Minister of Australia has been deposed, and wanting your help to draft an agenda, the new Prime Minister calls you and asks you what the 3 biggest problems in Australia are, barring climate change. What do you say are the 3 biggest problems?

For someone in astrophysics who is otherwise interested in educational equality, this was rough. Answering this meant spending a majority of my time (at least 2/3 options) on things not relevant to my field or my future goals, and I was called out for lacking direction immediately after answering this. There isn't much you can do to predict these questions, so know that there is some element of luck. Sometimes the questions are just rough for everyone.

I found the travel time and packed itinerary for this round to also be absolutely brutal, especially since it fell close to the final submission date of my thesis (the same day). Things may be more difficult at the national round because of these deadlines, so make sure you give it your best at the state level. Coming from Tasmania was also an issue because there are so few flights to Canberra on any one day, so you get stuck with an early-morning flight and end up sleep-deprived.

#### Gates

The interview process for Gates is less intensive and more specialised. As an international student you will be interviewed over Skype or phone. I found evening (8-9pm local time, early morning Cambridge) to be the best time, but make sure you don't have an intensive day beforehand or else you'll be too fried to think properly. I am definitely not a morning person, so the late interview may have worked in my favour.

Panels are grouped by general field, so if you're in the physical sciences you'll be interviewed by the physical sciences panel. My own didn't have any physicists, but it did have two engineers and a chemist. Because this panel is better equipped to discuss your research, make sure you really understand everything in your research proposal.

Personally, my interview focused on my proposed research and my outreach work. If your grades are lower, they might ask about those. If someone on the panel knows your field well, they may ask more about your previous research experience and question you more deeply on your proposed work. You will likely be given the names of those on your panel–give it a quick squiz to see if anyone’s in your field.

Acronyms in particular are easy picking. I was asked to explain AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement), and I am endlessly grateful that they asked me that one instead of MRI (magnetorotational instability). If anyone figures out a way to explain the MRI and how it works in 30 seconds, to a general audience, please let me know.
