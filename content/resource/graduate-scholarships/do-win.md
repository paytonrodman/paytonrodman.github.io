{{< hl >}}Congratulations!{{< /hl >}}

You now have to wait an excruciating amount of time for things to get rolling. Progress in terms of your application and visa comes in waves, interspersed with long periods of waiting. Try not to go insane.

Let people know about your success. Post it on Facebook, post it on Twitter, post it on your own blog, tell your university, tell the newspapers. Few students know about these opportunities and your representation can make a foreign experience look more approachable.

Finally: {{< hl >}}remember those who didn't win and remember the responsibility that you've accepted{{< /hl >}}. These scholarships aren't just money for you to chill out and have a good time, they come with the expectation that you will work hard and be an upstanding citizen. You will be scrutinized more heavily as a representative of your university, city, state, even country. It is a great opportunity, but it comes at a steep price.
