#### Baking tips

 - You don't need scales to get 250g of butter! The supermarket will probably sell butter in sticks of 250g.
 - You can use the wrapper from the butter stick, and its buttery residue, to grease the inside of your tins.
 - If you're unsure of the time needed, cook for the originally specified length and then check at 5-10 minute intervals. Don't leave it unattended, just to be safe. Remember every oven and dish is different, and will react differently to cook times and temperatures.
