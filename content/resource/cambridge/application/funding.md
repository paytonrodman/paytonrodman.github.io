### What does "funding" mean?

Postgraduate education (aka Masters and PhD) in the UK has an associated cost just like undergraduate degrees do. You are charged tuition, even as a PhD candidate who takes no classes. Cambridge will also charge you college fees and generic student fees. On top of all of this, you also need enough money to buy food, pay your rent and bills, and to generally live.

 - For a single UK resident with no dependents, this comes out to about £100,000 over 4 years.

 - For a single overseas student with no dependents, it'll be around £200,000.

 - If you have a partner or children to support, add more. For an overseas student bringing a spouse and 4 children, you're looking at £300,000.

And remember, these are all quite low estimates and you won't be living any sort of flashy lifestyle if you have only the recommended amount of money.

This is an exorbitant cost for anyone to pay upfront, and many students need additional support in the form of university or external funding. "Funding" can be for any amount, ranging from a small, one-time payment of £100 up to your full tuition + fees + living costs. 

At its most basic, funding is simply money you are given to help you cover the costs associated with your studies.

### What are the different kinds of funding?

We can broadly split these up into 5 groups:

- **University**: e.g. [Cambridge International Scholarship](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/scholarships/v-c-awards-and-cambridge-international-scholarships/)

- **Research Councils**: e.g. [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/skills/students/)

- **Department / research institute**: e.g. the [MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/students/international-phd-programme/funding/)

- **College**: e.g. [Jo Cox Ph.D Studentship](https://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/study-here/graduate/financial-support) at Pembroke College

- External sources, such as **charities** and **overseas governments**: e.g. [Gates Cambridge](https://www.gatescambridge.org/)

There can also be extra pots of money around under the name of a "bursary" or "top-up fund", so keep your eyes open and be sure to read the criteria for each award!

### How do I find them?

Following the examples above, your first port-of-call is the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/scholarships/). They link to all(?) Cambridge-proper funding, *plus* some of the college and department funds. You must remember: "Cambridge" and "the Cambridge colleges" are two different things! The other must-read is the university's [Funding Search Tool](https://www.student-funding.cam.ac.uk/) which should list all available college funds.

It's also a good idea to look at individual college websites to check what scholarships are on offer. If they want you to write a bespoke statement to apply for the scholarship, it'll be stated here.

Here are some links to learn more about [university funds](http://2021.postgraduate.study.staging.drupal.uis.cam.ac.uk/funding/university-funds), the [research councils](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/funding/research-council-ukri), [college funding](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/funding/college-funding), and [external funding](http://2021.postgraduate.study.staging.drupal.uis.cam.ac.uk/funding/external-funding).

### So, how do I actually apply?

**You will be considered for the majority of available scholarships *automatically* so long as you tick the box in your application.**

Some scholarships will ask that you write a statement addressing certain criteria.

Some college scholarships require that you list their college as your first choice.

Some larger scholarships, like Gates, require extra letters of reference, their own bespoke statement, and interviews.

### How are scholarships allocated?

It depends on their source and criteria.

Those awarded by the university-at-large (e.g. the Cambridge International) will generally be awarded based on merit, i.e. academic achievement. This is measured through your previous educational attainment and any publications or significant research work. The criteria for these will be quite vague, and they are usually available to many students across many areas of study.

Other scholarships, often those awarded by charities or philanthropists, can have more specific and strict criteria, and due to the law around these philanthropic donations, there is no wiggle room. A scholarship set up for the children of grocers in Nottingham cannot be awarded to the children of mechanics in Nottingham or the children of grocers in London. While merit is still taken into account, the awardee will be the best candidate who fulfils the criteria, and not necessarily the best candidate in the entire department. And if there is no candidate who fulfils the criteria then that scholarship will not be awarded that year.

The very best candidate for one scholarship is quite likely to be a top candidate for other scholarships too, and so the best candidates will often recieve multiple offers of funding. To keep things fair, you cannot receive more than you need to cover your base costs, and so someone awarded 2 full-cost scholarships must accept one and decline the other. The award they decline will then go to the second choice, the process repeating until someone accepts. This can take quite a few weeks, and it's part of the reason why some awards are still being given out in July and August.

Funds can also be paid in full or as a partial award, and this makes the funding process far more complicated. If we have a scholarship worth £60,000 then we could give the full £60k to a single student and cover their tuition and living costs entirely. Or we could award £30k to two students, or £20k to three, etc. Many students combine multiple smaller awards to cover their costs, so the £30k and £20k awards could be the final push that allows those students to attend Cambridge. In the first case (the full award), only one student is able to attend. In the other cases (splitting the award), we may have 2-3 students who can now attend. Again, the process whereby students consider the funding offer before accepting/declining can cause some awards to be given out quite late.
