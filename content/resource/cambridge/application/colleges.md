### These are just dorms right?

**No!**

Unlike "colleges" or "dormitories" in other universities around the world, the colleges at Cambridge (and Oxford) are quite independent, and your college membership can greatly change your experience of Cambridge.

To understand this fully, you have to realise that the colleges are *legally separate entities*. Rather than being subsidiary to the University of Cambridge, the 31 colleges operate independently. Each owns its own private property. Each is responsible for hiring its own staff. Each selects its own students. And each takes responsibility for the teaching of its own students, with nothing more than a gentleman's agreement between colleges and departments to occassionally educate students of another college where appropriate. 

This is most clearly seen at the undergraduate level, where applicants don't apply to the *university*, they apply to a *college*. If that college rejects them, they *may* be considered by another college, but this is paramount to being considered by another university, and colleges are under no obligation to read over the reject pile from any other college.

It's a much more complicated affair for postgraduates. You will be asked to list your 2 preferred college choices on your application, but unlike undergraduates, you apply to your *department* and the *university*, who have the ultimate say in your admission. If you are accepted, you must be assigned to a college. You may not get one of your preferences, but you are guaranteed *a* college nonetheless.

### But if my college choice doesn't impact my chances of admission, why should I care?

You should care because the colleges are incredibly varied, and some will be much better suited to you than others.

Some colleges are in the middle of town while others are on the outskirts, and many will be quite far from your department/office. Some colleges have better provisions to house families. Some colleges are better for musicians or athletes. And each college manages its own goody bag of scholarships and travel funds which you may be eligible for. Some colleges house postgraduates "on site", while others place them in flats dotted around the city.

Go for the prettiest, most famous college and you may end up living in a run-down flat, very far from your department, with no special amenities to suit your hobbies, and no additional funds to lean on. Or, in the worst-case scenario, you may end up in a college that cannot provide you with a scholarship, which for many applicants means they cannot afford to attend Cambridge at all. This is why your college choice (your preferences) are important, and it's why you must do your homework on each one to find the one that suits you best. 

### Okay, so where do I go to learn more about each college?

You can, of course, check out each college's webpages, but for 31 colleges that's a lot of reading! Thankfully, other people have made some very useful guides to help you narrow down your search.

This [The Student Room page](https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/wiki/Cambridge_College_Pros_and_Cons) is a crowdsourced list of the pros and cons of each college.

### So how exactly does college allocation work?

In your application, you put down 2 preferred colleges. For the sake of argument, let's say you put down Selwyn (1) and John's (2).

#### Choice 1

After you recieve a formal offer of admission from your department and the university at-large, your application is automatically passed on to Selwyn. Your applicant portal will say this. Selwyn applies its own selection criteria for students, including merit, likelihood of funding, subject, age, gender, and any other personal qualities they have information on. Maybe they already have a number of math PhDs and don't want any more. Maybe they have too many STEM students and want more from the Arts. Maybe they want more diversity in age. After a few hours or a few weeks, Selwyn will make a "decision" whether to take you or not. If they do, your journey stops here.

#### Choice 2

If Selwyn does not take you for whatever reason, you are then passed on to John's. Your applicant portal will say that your last college selection was unsuccessful and that you are now seeking placement at John's. John's will do as Selwyn did, applying its own admission criteria, many of which will not be based on merit alone. If John's accepts you, your journey stops here.

#### No choice

If John's does not take you for whatever reason (or if you have listed no preferences), then you will be circulated around other colleges. Whether this is random or not, I don't know. Being a postgraduate, you are *guaranteed* a college place, it's now just a matter of finding which college has space for you. Your applicant portal from now on will only say that you are seeking a college place, and it will not say *which* college is considering you anymore. This process is commonly known as "pooling", although this is a reference to the undergraduate process of pooling, which may not be wholly accurate for postgraduates. 

### Should I use my 2 preferences for Trinity and King's?

You can do whatever you want, but I'd caution against it for a few reasons.

Postgraduate admissions aren't on a single timescale. Some departments admit people early, but others do admissions quite late in the game. By the time you get an offer and your application is passed on to Trinity/King's, they may already be full or close to it because they are very often listed as preferences and get far more applications than they have space for.

This means you may as well have listed no preferences at all and will be pooled elsewhere. There is *absolutely nothing* you can do about this. There is *no recourse* available if this happens to you. 

**You don't get a third choice.**

**You don't get to change colleges if you don't like where you're pooled to.**

This can be particularly thorny if you are a woman and/or over the age of 21 (as most postgraduates are), as there are colleges dedicated to these populations which have many spaces left to fill. If you are going to be pooled anywhere, it is more likely to be here. Bear that in mind before you throw *both* of your preferences on the most oversubscribed colleges (Trinity, King's, Christ's, John's). Save at least one for another college that you would also be very happy to go to, that way you get more of a say over your eventual placement.

### Do I really have no choice over my final college allocation?

Yup.

There are some very limited circumstances where someone can apply to change college after allocation, typically either related to a disability or funding.

If your disability cannot be accommodated by your college, e.g. you are a wheelchair user and there are no available wheelchair-accessible rooms, you may be moved to another college which can accommodate you better. But you don't get to choose this other college, it's just whoever has space and the necessary resources.

Or, you may be awarded a scholarship which stipulates that you be a member of another college. In this case, you will be transferred to the college listed for the scholarship.

### Wait, colleges have their own scholarships?

Yes, each college has its own pot of money consisting of scholarships, bursaries, awards, and travel grants, many of which are unique to that college. Many college scholarships will require that you list that college as your first preference on your application, which makes college choice even more important since you can obviously only list one college as first preference. By *not* listing the other ~30 colleges as first preference, you are automatically out of the running for a lot of scholarships university-wide.

College scholarships can also be hard to find, sometimes buried in a college's website, only offered in odd years, or with a revolving door of names that change in a 10-year cycle.

And many will not automatically consider you just by virtue of your listing them as first preference. You *also* often need to list scholarships by name in your application, under the "Cambridge Trust Statement". This is why it's so important for you to do your research ahead of time and to keep a note of what you find. Know which colleges you will apply to before beginning your application. Know which scholarships you'll apply to and what their requirements are.

### What if I don't like my college?

This can sometimes happen, but it's not usually a permanent problem. A lot of people are unhappy with the college they are allocated to, but you're judging places you've never actually lived in. You've probably never even set foot in the city. In short, you don't know that you'll dislike it until you've actually lived there. Many students go on to enjoy their college, with the majority *loving* where they end up. While each college has its unique combination of strengths and weaknesses, they are all Cambridge colleges and have far more in common than you realise.

And even if you don't like it after living there for a year, there's no need to despair! Many PhDs move out of college accommodation for later years anyway, and when you're renting a flat in the city centre, your college membership is irrelevant. Unlike undergraduates, postgraduates are students of their department over their college and so you should expect to spend more time in your department than anywhere else. Your department will have its own library and social spaces. Aside from the occassional bit of paperwork, you never *have* to visit your college. Many only ever attend for the odd formal, others even less. It's not the end of the world to be pooled somewhere you don't enjoy. Cambridge is entirely what *you* make of it.

### Can I visit other colleges?

During "normal times", yes, but there are restrictions and each college makes its own rules here. The most permissible colleges will allow any Cambridge University member (i.e. student or staff) to wander through its grounds and use its hall. Others will allow entry to select areas or for tours, but only during certain hours or on certain days. Some colleges are a bit more restrictive and require you to be invited (and chaperoned) by one of their own students, which is a good incentive to form a large friendship group across many colleges. And the most restrictive colleges do not allow visitors at all except in very small numbers and for very specific activites in very limited areas.

The easiest way to visit another college is to be invited to one of their formal dinners by a student at that college. Many colleges also hold "Guest Nights" once per term specifically for this. You can also be invited to attend "bops" (Cambridge version of a party), or you can shell out a lot of money for a ticket to a college's May Ball (super fancy with black or white tie).

### Anything to know in light of COVID-19?

With the pandemic, many colleges have closed to non-members, meaning you cannot enter any college besides your own. This is for safety reasons as colleges are where people live, and by walking through common areas, you may as well be walking into someone's house. At the time of writing (Nov 2020), that's not exactly legal or safe. Many of the attractions in Cambridge are also now closed because they are officially on college land, and the colleges are closed.

COVID-19 had another important effect on colleges though: it opened a window onto their culture. Back in March, when we were all strongly advised to leave the University/city/country, some colleges took a more kindly approach than others. Not all colleges were kind or understanding. Some appeared positively *evil*. The way each college has treated its students during this crisis is a sign of their values. It may seem unfair to judge them during a crisis, but remember: that is precisely the time when it matters most. If or when there is another crisis, whether personal or global, you need to know that your college will support you.

And if it still feels unfair, look at how colleges responded at the end of 2020 during the second wave. They now have over 6 months' of preparation and the gift of hindsight. A lack of preparation at this point is willful.
