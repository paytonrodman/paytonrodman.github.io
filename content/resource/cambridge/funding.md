### What does "funding" mean?

Postgraduate education (aka Masters and PhD) in the UK has an associated cost just like undergraduate degrees do. You are charged tuition, even as a PhD candidate who takes no classes. Cambridge will also charge you college fees and generic student fees. On top of all of this, you also need enough money to buy food, pay your rent and bills, and to generally live.

 - For a single UK resident with no dependents, this comes out to about £100,000 over 4 years.

 - For a single overseas student with no dependents, it'll be around £200,000.

 - If you have a partner or children to support, add more. For an overseas student bringing a spouse and 4 children, you're looking at £300,000.

And remember, these are all quite low estimates and you won't be living any sort of flashy lifestyle if you have only the recommended amount of money.

This is an exorbitant cost for anyone to pay upfront, and many students need additional support in the form of university or external funding. "Funding" can be for any amount, ranging from a small, one-time payment of £100 up to your full tuition + fees + living costs. 

At its most basic, funding is simply money you are given to help you cover the costs associated with your studies.
