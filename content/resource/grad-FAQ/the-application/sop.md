### What's a statement of purpose?

A statement of purpose is a kind of professional essay. Over roughly 2-3 pages you will cover your background, your previous research experience, your career goals, and your desire to study at a particular program and/or with a particular supervisor. Where your CV/résumé is a short summary of your achievements, the statement of purpose gives you an opportunity to tie those achievements together into some narrative. You want the reader to have a strong sense of your skills, personal qualities, and research interests.

### How is it different to a personal statement?

They can be functionally identical, or completely unique documents. The confusion here is that, in my experience, many programs will request one or the other while expecting something that is a blend of both. 

A personal statement (PS) _should_ be more personal than a statement of purpose (SOP). Where the SOP is largely a discription of your qualifications and achievements, a PS might focus more on personal challenges you've overcome or extracurricular work which you think exemplifies some of your good qualities.
