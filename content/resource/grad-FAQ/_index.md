Applying to graduate programs can be very confusing, especially when you're looking to apply overseas or have a unusual background. So I've put together something of a guide based on my own experiences and the lessons I've learned from others over the years! Unlike many guides on the internet, I've tried to keep this as general and non-specific as possible so it can be useful regardless of your nationality or academic background. It will, however, still retain some bias, informed by my own experiences as an Australian expat who applied to Australia and the UK. 

Over the course of the following pages, I may openly contradict advice you have heard previously. This is done intentionally, as there are a great many ways to enter a graduate program, each suited to particular backgrounds and individual preferences. If you feel that a particular section is not relevant to you then it is not relevant to you.

I have also linked some other (very extensive!) guides in my [Useful Links](https://www.paytonelyce.com/resource/useful-links/applying/) page, so be sure to check those out!
