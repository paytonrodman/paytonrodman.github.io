Note in this section I refer to grades in the form of a GPA. When translating between grading systems, remember to translate via grade _tags_ rather than by _number_, so a High Distinction (HD; 80%) in Australia is equivalent to an A+ (95%) in the US.

## How much does GPA matter?

## Mine is lower than I'd like. What can I do?

## What's the minimum I need for a particular program?
