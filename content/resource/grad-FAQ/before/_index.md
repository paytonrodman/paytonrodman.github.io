The work for a PhD or Masters degree starts well before you craft your application materials and begins first with some of the most important questions you can ask yourself in this process: 

- [Are you well-suited to doing a PhD/Masters?](https://www.paytonelyce.com/resource/grad-faq/before/general/)

- [Are your grades high enough?](https://www.paytonelyce.com/resource/grad-faq/before/grades/)

- [Do you have enough research experience?](https://www.paytonelyce.com/resource/grad-faq/before/research/)

- [How should you find places to apply to?](https://www.paytonelyce.com/resource/grad-faq/before/find-supervisors/)

- [Can you afford it? What's this "stipend" thing people talk about?](https://www.paytonelyce.com/resource/grad-faq/before/funding/)
