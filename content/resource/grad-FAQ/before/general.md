You should do whatever is best for you! A PhD can be a lot of fun and the qualification may be useful to you, but it’s also 3-8+ years of your life on relatively low pay and the applications often do cost money.

I will say that the return on investment for a PhD may not be as high as you imagine, and that it’s quite likely you could get the same jobs with a Masters degree, or even just your Bachelors. Whether or not you truly need a PhD to reach your career goals is the first thing you have to figure out. After that, it’s really a matter of whether you want to or not.

It is true that the PhD will always be there, and you can theoretically come back to the idea in the future but bear in mind that it can get harder to procure application documents the longer you wait. This is particularly true in the case of letters of recommendation. A short gap of <5 years is unlikely to be a problem, but it may get harder once you’re passing decades.

## How many programs should I apply to?

This can vary hugely by field, country, and individual! It’s largely a function of how competitive that program is and your relative position in the applicant pool but will also be set by your own preferences and constraints. As you can see in my profile, I applied to 4, but this list was originally planned to be much longer (>10) in line with the norm of my field. I cut back on the number because the application process–especially across multiple countries with different academic years–became too much work.

Researching, writing, and managing your applications can be a lot of work, and if you have other commitments vying for your time then you should be realistic with your school list and not overcommit yourself. A rushed application is a worse application and may be bad enough that you stand no reasonable chance of acceptance. Forcing yourself to push out a lot of these rushed applications therefore isn’t in your best interest, and likely isn’t a good use of your time or money. However, while it is true that you only need 1 offer, it’s always better to have a handful to choose from so you can maximise your funding, fit, and overall happiness. These are competing interests, and the number of schools you apply to is set by your personal balance point of these factors.

In terms of the notion of “safety”, “match”, and “reach”, these are more suited to undergraduate admissions and you shouldn’t consider them. A true “safety” is any option which is 100% guaranteed, and so the only safety you have is the program you currently hold an official, unconditional offer to. If you are reading this for advice then you probably haven’t even started applying yet, let alone have offers, and so this concept of a “safety” is worthless in planning where to apply to. In terms of “match” and “reach”: it can be incredibly hard to gauge what your profile looks like relative to the pool of applicants you compete against. Your own undergraduate group is unrepresentative, as are all research programs you’ve been a part of, and all internet chat boards. So, while the terms “match” and “reach” probably could be applied to the programs on your list, you can only know which is which in hindsight, if ever. The only exception here are programs which you do not meet the clearly stated entry requirements for. These can be a true gamble depending on your precise background in relation to the program.

## Should I do a Masters first?

Firstly, this will be dictated by your current qualifications and the stated entry requirements for the program you’re applying to. This varies both by the country of origin for your previous degrees and the country you’re applying to for PhD.

Assuming a Masters isn’t strictly required in your case, it then comes down to preferences and finances. If your previous degrees were in a slightly different area then you may want to “get your feet wet” in the new subject with a shorter degree before jumping headfirst into a lengthy PhD. You might also feel that you’d like more research experience, or a chance to take (or retake) certain classes in order to be more competitive for PhD programs.

Depending on where you are coming from, a Masters degree may be relatively simple to get in the sense that it e.g. comes as the fourth year of your undergraduate degree, or is automatically fully-funded. In other cases, Masters can require separate applications and may be expensive.
