### Who am I?

Welcome!

I'm Payton, the author of this guide :sunglasses:

It should be noted that this is nothing more than a compilation of my own experiences and those of others I've talked to. As with many things in higher education, a great deal changes depending on the country, field, and student, and so you should remember that my view is that of an Australian expat studying astronomy in the UK. I try to keep advice as generic as possible to help as many people as possible, but there will still always be a bias â€” both to my own experiences and towards the US. I've linked some extra compilations by others on the resources page, so do please check those out as well!

If you are an undergraduate student, particularly if you are early on in your degree, then I also have a guide to undergraduate page with more tips for managing things like work, study, and disability.

I have my stats below for the curious, but for the rest, I hope you will find I'm just a normal person. The main ethos for this guide is "do what you can with what you have"! Remember that no door is ever truly closed to you, there are only more or less circuitous routes.

### The stats
