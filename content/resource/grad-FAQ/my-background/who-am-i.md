Welcome!

I'm Payton, the author of this guide :sunglasses:

It should be noted that this is nothing more than a compilation of my own experiences and those of others I've talked to. As with many things in higher education, a great deal changes depending on the country, field, and student, and so you should remember that my view is that of an Australian expat studying astronomy. I try to keep advice as generic as possible to help as many people as possible, but there will still always be a bias. I've linked some extra compilations by others on the [resources page](rodman.netlify.app/resource/), so do please check those out as well!

If you are an undergraduate student, particularly if you are early on in your degree, then I also have a [guide to undergraduate](https://payton-rodman.netlify.app/resource/) page with more tips for managing things like work, study, and disability.

I have my stats below for the curious, but for the rest, I hope you will find I'm just a normal person. The main ethos for this guide is "do what you can with what you have"!
