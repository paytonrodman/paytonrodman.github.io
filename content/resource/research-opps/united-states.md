There are so many research opportunities on US soil that it would be pretty exhausting and redundant to list them all here, especially when tools already exist to search through them!

The most extensive listing I'm aware of is through [pathwaystoscience.org](https://www.pathwaystoscience.org/programs.aspx?adv=adv), whose Advanced Search feature lets you select programs based on their citizenship requirements and much more.
