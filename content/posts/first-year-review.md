Necessary context: In my department, we spend the first year of the PhD formally on "probation". At the end of the year we submit a 10,000 word report comprised of a paper or literature review plus a proposal for our future research. We're then interviewed on this report, and are either recommended for registration :relieved: or recommended with revisions/resubmission :confused:. If resubmission is unsuccessful then you're given the option to complete a Masters degree or to leave immediately without a degree :disappointed:. In many ways, it is our version of the US "qualifying exam", with the same pressures and pitfalls.

My first-year review was never going to be a good experience, as much as I wished it would be. The last 12 months have been misery, with constant setbacks and bad news at every turn, even before the pandemic. But the pandemic certainly exacerbated things, and the final result was an interview over a shoddy internet connection, 9000 miles removed from my examiners and my research, with only ~3 months of effective research time completed compared to the normal ~11-12 months, all cloaked within a year that has been ruinous at best. But the funny thing is that the world keeps churning under our feet, time progressing on at a pace of 1 second per second, regardless of what happens in our lives. 11 months had progressed since I started the PhD, and the law of the land says I must take my qualifier, and so I did.

In short, I was unprepared.

What happened next was so predictable that I had, in fact, predicted it.

{{< tweet 1300808270903300098 >}}

What I couldn't predict was the _nature_ of the "terrible".

The unfortunate fact of interviews, qualifying exams, and defences is that you can ask people what it's like until you're blue in the face, but every experience is so unique and unpredictable that you're really no better off. In my case, everyone around me kept saying the same things: you'll be fine, it's just a casual chat, they just want to talk about how you feel about your progress, it's just a check to make sure you're happy with supervision. I don't believe they were lying, ignorant, or malicious. It's a plain good idea to reassure someone who's feeling anxious and I would have (and _have_) done the same. But the result was that I entered with my guard down. After all, these are experts who have spent the last 31+ days reading my report and my impact statement regarding COVID-19, and they're there to provide me with guidance and constructive criticism, what could go wrong?

## 1. Poor preparation

Any exam, even one that purports to be a casual chat, is going to test your knowledge and skills. To best show what you know, you need clarity of thought. Not only do you need the mental space to show your skills, you also need space to accept criticism and advice so that you can become an even better researcher.

If you enter the exam lacking adequate preparation or otherwise in a bad situation, not only will the exam not help you to grow, it won't even be an accurate assessment of your progress.

It's also possible to be ill-prepared for the _format_ of the exam. 

### The solution

For subject preparation you should review your report thoroughly. Try reading it out loud to catch any small mistakes or inconsistencies. For equations, double check that you have defined all terms in the text. 

As best you can, avoid doing quals during a pandemic or any other time of extreme stress! If you're going through a very rough time then you can often request to delay these exams and you _should_ take that option if you're not in a good mindset to perform well.

As for the format, your ideal information source will be the examiners themselves, who should be honest about what they expect. If you're not allowed to contact your examiners or you're still unsure, you can also ask your supervisor, a graduate advisor, and students who have gone through the process before. Their experiences/advice will all be different, but you may be able to define the extremes or to find common threads.

## 2. Misunderstandings

Terminology is not a constant thing, and the meaning of words changes depending on the subfield. Conventions also vary, and what is considered good practice in one field is seen as sloppy in another. If your examiners are in quite different fields to your own then you can see this play out live: they will ask you questions that don't make any sense. 

They may be worded so reasonably that you don't realise it's nonsense at first, but when you view it through the lens of your field, it falls apart. From your point of view, you can't answer the question because the string of words doesn't make any sense. From the examiner's point of view, you are seemingly incapable of understanding their question, possibly because you lack the knowledge to understand the string of words.

You are both correct.

### The solution

First, don't assume your examiners are going to ask reasonable questions—no one is infallible. If you don't think you understand a question, repeat it back to the examiner in your own words. Ask for clarification. If all else fails, explain clearly _why_ you feel the question is unanswerable. And take a note of what these questions were, since they indicate areas of your report that are unclear.

## 3. The "bad" examiner

If you have any choice in choosing your examiners, whether for a qualifying event or for you final thesis defense, you've probably heard about the dreaded "bad" examiner. These can be highly qualified and much loved individuals within your field. They can be junior researchers. They can be members of a minoritized group. Suffice it to say, you won't know who's a "bad" examiner through looks or renown alone.

Who is the "bad" examiner? In the most general sense, they're someone who isn't going to assist you in becoming a better researcher. They don't read the report. They question students far more aggressively than is justifiable. They level personal insults at students. They discriminate based on race, gender, disability, or other protected class. They use the space of the exam to enact personal conflicts with other examiners.

The "bad" examiner is a bully and you ought to see them as such.

### The solution

Unfortunately, very few people are willing to name bullies as such and will use euphemisms like "tough" instead, so you should be on the lookout for these. These examiners _may_ be of the genuinely "tough but fair" type, but it can also be a dogwhistle for "too aggressive and arrogant". Unfortunately the verbal distinction between genuine compliment and euphemism can be very slight and very short-lived. You may miss the hint, or be given no hint at all. It isn't your fault.

Bullies are tenacious in academia because there are relatively few paths to report them. As a first step you should let someone within your department know what happened, ideally your supervisor or another senior academic you trust. This "local" step is usually required before you can formally report to a higher level. You should not feel pressured to enter formal complaints, nor to sweep everything under the rug and forget about it. The harm caused by these people is real and there is no excuse for bullying and harrassment.

You should ask that the person not be on any of your future committees or examining boards—you are under no obligation to provide them with an opportunity for redemption. As for protecting others, beyond making a formal complaint your only real option is to warn other students. The complexities of power differentials, particularly if the examiner is a prominent researcher in your field, can make direct language here very difficult. You may feel uncomfortable explicitly naming them or their behaviour. You may also resort to euphemisms. I'd encourage you to make your experiences known in whatever way you can, but the ultimate decision in how to do that is up to you. It is your experience to tell, and the final bit of power you retain is in the telling of your story.

## Takeaway

The most important thing to do after an exam like this is to separate the wheat from the chaff. What advice was valid and useful? What was irrelevant, incorrect, or unconstructive? If you're unsure if a piece of feedback is constructive or not, run it through with your supervisor. They know you and your work better than your examiner does, and their opinion has greater weight. If they attribute a certain comment or piece of criticism to one of the pitfalls mentioned above, trust them in that assessment and try not to dwell on the negative comments. 

At some point, either before this debriefing exercise or shortly after, you should take some time away from the report and the examiners' comments. Use some of your annual leave, engage in self-care, or redirect your energy towards another project that you're excited about. This is especially important if your exam process was a brutal one as you'll need time to recover. It's normal to feel burnt out, it's normal to feel unhappy after passing your exam with flying colours, and it's normal to lose all passion for your work for a while. It's so common that it has its own name: post-quals slump. It isn't a sign that you're somehow a failure or that you ought to drop out, although you may have those feelings. Give things time to settle and talk to someone if you're struggling. Don't make a decision right away.

Look out for your friends too. I've spoken to so many others who have had similarly dispiriting quals experiences, but who never spoke up because they felt ashamed or as though their feelings were wrong. Incredibly successful and confident people who had awful exams just like yours. Tell others how you feel and you will quickly find that you are not alone.
