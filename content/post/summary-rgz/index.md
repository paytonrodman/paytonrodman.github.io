## Overview

At the centre of pretty much every massive galaxy, there is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with millions or billions of times the mass of our Sun. As material falls in it forms an accretion disk which rotates with the black hole. Much of this material will eventually accrete but some may be redirected up and over the black hole, where it is launched outwards at near the speed of light and forms a pair of polar jets. These jets can be exceptionally large, and may be many times longer than their host galaxy is wide. As such, they live in the space between galaxiesâ€”the intergalactic medium (IGM).

What is canonically known as "empty" space is not, in fact, empty. There isn't *much* material in the IGM but there is *some*, and since our jets are also quite light, it's natural to expect some interaction between them. This would be amplified if the jets came close to another galaxy, or to a cluster of galaxies, where the density increases.

We sought to investigate this idea with our Radio Galaxy Zoo project.

Using radio images of black hole jets, we compared the length and brightness of the jets to the density of the surrounding environment (more nearby galaxies = more dense), finding that the brighter/shorter jet in any pair tends to sit in a more dense environment.

## Specifics

### The jets

#### Caveat

I should first say that while we have a few ideas of how astrophysical jets are formed (e.g. the Blandford-Znajek and Penrose processes), we're still not entirely sure. As you'll see later on, we don't have incredibly high resolution images for most systems, and even our best images can't see what's happening right near the black hole. The problem is the accretion disk: it's too bright. The region around the black hole is one indiscriminate blob of light with little or no detail. 

But for the purposes of this study we're not too concerned with how the jets got there. We assume that the jets produced either side of a black hole are functionally identical, and so any difference in shape/brightness must be due to the environment they're in.

#### Jet types

Astronomy is a very old field and many astrophysical phenomena were named based on observations, not on theory. Because of this, we have a lot of confusing naming systems in astronomy that are based on appearance, or *apparent* appearance, and jets are no exception.

In our paper, we use the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classification system which classifies jets into two main groups, known as Type 1 (FR-I) and Type 2 (FR-II).
