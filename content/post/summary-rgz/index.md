At the centre of pretty much every massive galaxy, there is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with millions or billions of times the mass of our Sun. As material falls in it forms an accretion disk which rotates with the black hole. Much of this material will eventually accrete but some may be redirected up and over the black hole before it is launched outwards at near the speed of light, forming a pair of polar jets. These jets can be exceptionally large, and may be many times longer than their host galaxy is wide. As such, they live out in the space between galaxiesâ€”the intergalactic medium (IGM).
