## Summary of Research Interests
My current research, supervised by Professor Christopher Reynolds, focuses on the production of strong magnetic fields via dynamo action within accretion discs around supermassive black holes, such as those found in the centres of massive galaxies. My thesis aims to investigate different field configurations and their evolution using the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) code Athena++.

## Research Experience
**Undergraduate Vacation Scholar**, CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, Nov 2016—Feb 2017
- Supervisor: Dr Cormac Reynolds
- Used large-scale, multi-epoch surveys to study variability in radio sources caused by inhomogeneities in the interstellar and intergalactic medium.  
    
**Summer Research Student**, University of Tasmania, Nov 2015—Feb 2016 
- Supervisors: Dr Stanislav Shabala, Dr Ross Turner  
- Used data from the citizen science project Radio Galaxy Zoo to study whether nearby galaxy clustering affects the physical properties of AGN jets, with focus on classical double radio galaxies.
